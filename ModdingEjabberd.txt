So far I managed to use the package manager brew to install ejabberd from source

Look in /usr/local/etc/ejabberd for the config file
Look in /usr/local/sbin for the ejabberdctl script

To add the first user

1) /usr/local/sbin/ejabberdctl start

2) /usr/local/sbin/ejabberdctl register admin localhost password

3) Add this at the bottom of /usr/local/etc/ejabberd.cfg to give the user admin rights:

{acl, admin, {user, "admin", "localhost"}}.
{access, configure, [{allow, admin}]}.

4) Do additional configuration through localhost:5280/admin in a web browser
login: admin
password: password

Next steps:
----------------------
1) Try running one of the source modules in the erlang interpreter
2) Write a module for apple push
3) re compile the module for localhost
